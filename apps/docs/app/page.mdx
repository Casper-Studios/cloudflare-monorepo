# Introduction

Welcome to the Cloudflare monorepo documentation. This project is a full-stack application built with Next.js for the frontend and Cloudflare Workers for the backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.3.0 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher

### Installation

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Start all apps in development mode:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The dev command will:
1. Copy database migrations from `packages/db/drizzle` to `apps/server/migrations`
2. Apply migrations to your local D1 database
3. Start all apps in parallel:
   - **Docs app** (Next.js) - typically at `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Server** (Cloudflare Workers) - typically at `http://localhost:8787`

That's it! Everything you need runs automatically.

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start all apps in development mode
- `bun run build` - Build all apps for production
- `bun run lint` - Run linters across all packages
